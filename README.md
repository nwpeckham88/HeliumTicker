# HeliumTicker
ESP8266 powered, internet connected scrolling LED ticker to display my Helium miner's information (so I stop obsessively checking my phone) and display an animation when we mine some HNT. Also, a clock. If you want. But, who cares what time it is when you can watch your miner pluck money from the air.

Currently supports display of 24hr total, 30 day total, wallet total, oracle price, and a 40hr/wk pay equivalent calculation (30 days/160 hours*oracle price. I know the math is /technically/ a little off, but its just something to compare to)
